# Goals

Chris Done's HaskellNext wishlist:
- CAS (content-addressable storage) out of the box like Unison
- A Haskell compiler that fully embraces the Lisp image in which I can update definitions in place, avoid type erasure so that I can inspect things running live, and for bonus points provide a way to migrate programs live.
- An Erlang-style runtime i.e. no shared memory, separate GCs per process, supervisors, etc.
- A Lisp like macro system from the beginning.
- A single statically linked self contained binary, with some batteries included, like DrScheme.
